- Added new API models: `ExamHistory`, `RecentActivity`, `ApiResponse<T>`
- Added `getStudentExamHistory()` method
- Added `getStudentRecentActivities()` method
- Added `getEnhancedStudentDashboard()` for comprehensive data loading

### 3. âœ… Updated Auth Service
**File:** `src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts`
- Enhanced `setCurrentUser()` to store `userId`, `userProfile`, and `yearId`
- Updated `initializeAuthState()` to load enhanced auth data from localStorage
- Updated `logout()` to clear all new auth data
- Added helper methods:
  - `getUserId(): number | null`
  - `getUserProfile(): any | null`
  - `getYearId(): number | null`

### 4. âœ… Upgraded Student Dashboard Component
**File:** `src/app/features/student-dashboard/student-dashboard.component.ts`
- Updated to use real backend endpoints instead of mock data
- Added `processRealDashboardData()` method
- Added `calculateStatsFromRealData()` method
- Enhanced to use `getUserId()` from auth service
- Fallback to mock data if backend is not available
- Uses new `ExamHistory` and `RecentActivity` models

### 5. âœ… Enhanced Dashboard UI
**File:** `src/app/features/student-dashboard/student-dashboard.component.html`
- Updated exam history display to use real `ExamHistory` data
- Added comprehensive Recent Activities section
- Added activity type icons and styling
- Improved responsive design and user experience

## ðŸ”— API Endpoints Integration

### âœ… Authentication Endpoints
```typescript
POST /api/Account/login
POST /api/Account/register-parent
POST /api/Account/register-teacher

// Now returns enhanced AuthResponse with userId and userProfile
```

### âœ… Student Dashboard Endpoints
```typescript
GET /api/Dashboard/student              // Main dashboard data
GET /api/Progress/by-student/{id}       // Student progress
GET /api/Certificates/student/{id}      // Student certificates
GET /api/Achievements/student/{id}      // Student achievements
GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/{id}/subscriptions-summary // Subscriptions
```

### âœ… NEW Endpoints (Backend Implemented)
```typescript
GET /api/Exam/student/{studentId}/history          // âœ… Integrated
GET /api/Student/{studentId}/recent-activities     // âœ… Integrated
```

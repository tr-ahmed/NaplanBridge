# ‚ùì Backend Inquiry Report

## üìÖ Date: November 1, 2025

---

## 1. Inquiry Topic

**API Endpoints Status and Error Resolution for Student Dashboard**

---

## 2. Reason for Inquiry

During frontend integration testing for the Student Dashboard, multiple API endpoints are returning errors or are not functioning as expected. The frontend needs clarification on the current status and proper usage of these endpoints.

---

## 3. API Endpoints with Issues

### üî¥ Critical Issues (500 Internal Server Error)

#### A. `/api/Exam/student/{studentId}/history`
- **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
- **Expected Response:** List of student's completed exams with scores
- **Current Status:** Backend implementation exists (confirmed earlier) but failing at runtime

#### B. `/api/Certificates/student/{studentId}` 
- **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
- **Expected Response:** List of student's earned certificates
- **Current Status:** Endpoint exists in swagger but failing at runtime

### üü° Missing Endpoints (404 Not Found)

#### C. `/api/Dashboard/student`
- **Error:** 404 Not Found
- **Expected Response:** Student dashboard summary data
- **Current Status:** May not be implemented yet, though mentioned in swagger

#### D. `/api/Progress/by-student/{id}`
- **Error:** 404 Not Found  
- **Expected Response:** Student progress across subjects/lessons
- **Current Status:** Exists in swagger but returning 404

---

## 4. Requested Details from Backend Team

### For 500 Internal Server Error Endpoints:

1. **Error Logs Analysis**
   - What is causing the internal server errors?
   - Are there database/entity relationship issues?
   - Are there missing data dependencies?

2. **Data Requirements**
   - Do these endpoints require specific test data to function?
   - Are there database seeds that need to be run?
   - What is the minimum data structure needed?

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Are these endpoints properly configured for student role access?
   - Are JWT tokens being validated correctly?
   - Is the student ID parameter validation working?

### For 404 Not Found Endpoints:

1. **Implementation Status**
   - Are these endpoints actually implemented in the current deployment?
   - If not implemented, what is the expected timeline?
   - Are there alternative endpoints we can use temporarily?

2. **Swagger Documentation Accuracy**
   - Does the swagger.json reflect the actual deployed API?
   - Are there discrepancies between documentation and implementation?

---

## 5. Testing Context

### Test Environment
- **Frontend URL:** `http://localhost:4200`
- **Backend URL:** `https://naplan2.runasp.net`
- **Student ID Used:** `8`
- **Authentication:** JWT token (student role)

### Error Traces Available
```
Trace IDs for investigation:
- bd22c99c-5f77-4920-bb6b-7758a02eba86
- 33301b9c-73bd-4a1b-abe1-d5736dabcfe0  
- 91743039-baf8-4e57-80d7-82777419315c
```

---

## 6. Immediate Workarounds Applied

### Frontend Adaptations Made:
1. **Error Handling Enhanced** - Added try/catch blocks for all API calls
2. **Fallback Data** - Using mock data when endpoints fail
3. **Graceful Degradation** - Dashboard still loads with limited functionality
4. **Individual Endpoint Loading** - Loading data separately instead of combined calls

### Temporary Solution:
```typescript
// Only using confirmed working endpoints:
- /api/StudentSubjects/student/{studentId}/subscriptions-summary ‚úÖ
- /api/Achievements/student/{studentId} ‚ùì (needs testing)
- /api/Achievements/student/{studentId}/points ‚ùì (needs testing)
```

---

## 7. Expected Resolution Information

### Required from Backend Team:

1. **Status Update** for each failing endpoint:
   - Root cause of 500 errors
   - Fix timeline
   - Testing instructions

2. **Alternative Solutions** if endpoints cannot be fixed immediately:
   - Temporary workaround endpoints
   - Modified response formats
   - Different API approach

3. **Database Setup** if required:
   - Seed data scripts
   - Migration requirements
   - Test data creation

4. **Authentication Verification:**
   - Confirm JWT token validation is working
   - Verify role-based access control
   - Check student ID parameter handling

---

## 8. Impact Assessment

### Current Impact:
- ‚ùå Student Dashboard partially functional
- ‚ùå Exam history not available to students
- ‚ùå Progress tracking not working
- ‚ùå Certificate display not working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited student engagement

### Business Impact:
- Students cannot see their learning progress
- Parents cannot track student performance
- Reduced platform value proposition
- Potential user frustration and churn

---

## 9. Priority Level

**üî• HIGH PRIORITY** - Core student functionality is affected

### Recommended Resolution Order:
1. **First:** Fix `/api/Exam/student/{studentId}/history` (critical for student motivation)
2. **Second:** Fix `/api/Progress/by-student/{id}` (essential for progress tracking)
3. **Third:** Fix `/api/Dashboard/student` (nice-to-have summary endpoint)
4. **Fourth:** Fix `/api/Certificates/student/{studentId}` (important for achievements)

---

## 10. Communication Request

### Preferred Response Format:
1. **Status Update Email/Message** with current situation
2. **Technical Details** for each endpoint issue
3. **Timeline** for fixes
4. **Testing Instructions** once resolved

### Response Timeline Needed:
- **Immediate:** Status acknowledgment
- **Within 24 hours:** Root cause analysis
- **Within 48 hours:** Fix implementation or workaround

---

## üìû Contact Information

- **Frontend Team:** Ready to test and verify fixes
- **Current Workaround:** Dashboard using mock data and graceful fallbacks
- **Testing Environment:** Fully setup and ready for immediate testing

## üîç **UPDATE: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

### ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED:** All Endpoints Are Implemented

After thorough code inspection, **ALL ENDPOINTS EXIST** in the backend codebase. The errors are due to specific technical issues that can be fixed quickly.

### üéØ **SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED:**

#### 1. **ExamService.GetStudentExamHistoryAsync (500 Error Fix)**
**File:** `API\Services\Implementations\ExamService.cs`
**Issue:** Missing `.ThenInclude(e => e.Questions)` causing null reference
**Fix Required:**
```csharp
// Current (failing):
var examHistory = await context.StudentExams
    .Include(se => se.Exam)  // ‚ùå Missing Questions
    
// Fixed (working):
var examHistory = await context.StudentExams
    .Include(se => se.Exam)
    .ThenInclude(e => e.Questions)  // ‚úÖ Add this line
```

#### 2. **CertificateService Null Reference (500 Error Fix)**  
**File:** `API\Services\Implementations\CertificateService.cs`
**Issue:** `c.Subject.SubjectName!.Name` can throw null reference
**Fix Required:**
```csharp
// Current (failing):
SubjectName = c.Subject.SubjectName!.Name  // ‚ùå May be null

// Fixed (working):
SubjectName = c.Subject?.SubjectName?.Name  // ‚úÖ Safe navigation
```

#### 3. **Dashboard/Progress 404 Errors**
**Likely Cause:** Code deployment issue
**Fix Required:** Verify latest code is deployed to production server

### ‚è±Ô∏è **ESTIMATED FIX TIME: 30 minutes**
1. Apply code fixes (10 min)
2. Build and test locally (10 min)  
3. Deploy to production (10 min)

### üß™ **IMMEDIATE TESTING SCRIPT:**
```bash
# Test all endpoints after fixes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://naplan2.runasp.net/api/Exam/student/8/history

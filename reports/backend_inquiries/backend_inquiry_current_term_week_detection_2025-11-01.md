# ‚ùì Backend Inquiry Report - Current Term/Week Detection

## Date: November 1, 2025

---

## 1. Inquiry Topic

**Create endpoint to determine student's current term and week based on subscription dates**

---

## 2. Reason for Inquiry

### Current Problem:

On the **Courses page**, when a student clicks "View Lessons" or the "‚úì Enrolled" button:
- ‚ùå Frontend doesn't know which term the student should be viewing
- ‚ùå Currently defaults to Term 1 (wrong if student is in Term 2, 3, or 4)
- ‚ùå No way to determine current week within the term

**Example Scenario:**
```
Student subscription: "Algebra Year 7 - Full Year" (4 Terms)
Today's date: November 1, 2025

Question: Is the student in Term 1, 2, 3, or 4?
Answer: Frontend has NO way to know!

Current behavior: Always opens Term 1 (wrong!)
Expected behavior: Open current term based on today's date
```

---

## 3. Requested Endpoint

### **Option 1: Get Current Term/Week for Student (Recommended)**

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/{studentId}/current-term-week`

**Purpose**: Return the current term and week that the student should be viewing based on:
- Student's active subscription
- Today's date
- Term start/end dates
- Week calculation within term

**Authorization**: Student, Parent, Admin

**Request Example**:
```http
GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/8/current-term-week
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response Schema**:
```json
{
  "studentId": 8,
  "currentTermId": 2,
  "currentTermNumber": 2,
  "currentTermName": "Term 2",
  "currentWeekId": 15,
  "currentWeekNumber": 5,
  "termStartDate": "2025-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  "termEndDate": "2025-06-30T23:59:59Z",
  "weekStartDate": "2025-04-29T00:00:00Z",
  "weekEndDate": "2025-05-05T23:59:59Z",
  "totalWeeksInTerm": 12,
  "weeksRemaining": 7,
  "progressPercentage": 42,
  "subscriptionType": "FullYear",
  "hasAccess": true
}
```

---

### **Option 2: Get Current Term/Week for Subject**

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/{studentId}/subject/{subjectId}/current-term-week`

**Purpose**: Same as Option 1 but specific to a subject (for students with multiple subscriptions)

---

## 4. Backend Logic Suggestions

### A. Calculate Current Term

```csharp
public async Task<CurrentTermWeekDto> GetCurrentTermWeek(int studentId, int? subjectId = null)
{
    var today = DateTime.UtcNow;
    
    // 1. Get student's active subscription(s)
    var activeSubscriptions = await _context.StudentSubjects
        .Include(ss => ss.SubscriptionPlan)
            .ThenInclude(sp => sp.Term)
        .Where(ss => ss.StudentId == studentId && 
                     ss.IsActive && 
                     ss.StartDate <= today && 
                     ss.EndDate >= today)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    if (subjectId.HasValue)
    {
        activeSubscriptions = activeSubscriptions
            .Where(ss => ss.SubscriptionPlan.SubjectId == subjectId)
            .ToList();
    }
    
    if (!activeSubscriptions.Any())
    {
        return new CurrentTermWeekDto { HasAccess = false };
    }
    
    // 2. Determine current term based on today's date
    Term currentTerm = null;
    
    // If Full Year subscription
    if (activeSubscriptions.Any(ss => ss.SubscriptionPlan.PlanType == PlanType.FullYear))
    {
        // Find which term we're in based on term dates
        currentTerm = await _context.Terms
            .Where(t => t.StartDate <= today && t.EndDate >= today)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    }
    // If Single/Multi Term subscription
    else
    {
        var subscription = activeSubscriptions.First();
        currentTerm = subscription.SubscriptionPlan.Term;
    }
    
    if (currentTerm == null)
    {
        return new CurrentTermWeekDto { HasAccess = false };
    }
    
    // 3. Calculate current week within the term
    var daysSinceTermStart = (today - currentTerm.StartDate).Days;
    var currentWeekNumber = (daysSinceTermStart / 7) + 1;
    
    // 4. Get the Week entity (if exists)
    var currentWeek = await _context.Weeks
        .Where(w => w.TermId == currentTerm.Id && w.WeekNumber == currentWeekNumber)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    
    // 5. Calculate progress
    var totalDaysInTerm = (currentTerm.EndDate - currentTerm.StartDate).Days;
    var progressPercentage = (int)((daysSinceTermStart / (double)totalDaysInTerm) * 100);
    
    return new CurrentTermWeekDto
    {
        StudentId = studentId,
        CurrentTermId = currentTerm.Id,
        CurrentTermNumber = currentTerm.TermNumber,
        CurrentTermName = currentTerm.Name,
        CurrentWeekId = currentWeek?.Id,
        CurrentWeekNumber = currentWeekNumber,
        TermStartDate = currentTerm.StartDate,
        TermEndDate = currentTerm.EndDate,
        WeekStartDate = currentWeek?.StartDate,
        WeekEndDate = currentWeek?.EndDate,
        TotalWeeksInTerm = await _context.Weeks.CountAsync(w => w.TermId == currentTerm.Id),
        WeeksRemaining = (int)((currentTerm.EndDate - today).Days / 7),
        ProgressPercentage = progressPercentage,
        SubscriptionType = activeSubscriptions.First().SubscriptionPlan.PlanType.ToString(),
        HasAccess = true
    };
}
```

---

### B. Handle Edge Cases

1. **Subscription not started yet**:
```csharp
if (today < subscription.StartDate)
{
    // Return first term/week
    return GetFirstTermWeek(subscription);
}
```

2. **Subscription expired**:
```csharp
if (today > subscription.EndDate)
{
    return new CurrentTermWeekDto { HasAccess = false };
}
```

3. **Between terms** (e.g., holidays):
```csharp
if (today > currentTerm.EndDate && today < nextTerm.StartDate)
{
    // Return next term
    return GetNextTermInfo(subscription);
}
```

4. **Student has multiple subscriptions** (different subjects):
```csharp
// Pass subjectId to filter
GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/8/subject/5/current-term-week
```

---

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Full Year Subscription

**Scenario:**
- Student: Ali Ahmed (ID: 8)
- Subscription: "Mathematics Year 7 - Full Year"
- Subscription dates: 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31
- Today: 2025-11-01

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "currentTermId": 4,
  "currentTermNumber": 4,
  "currentTermName": "Term 4",
  "currentWeekNumber": 3,
  "hasAccess": true
}
```

**Frontend Action:**
- Navigate to: `/lessons?termId=4&weekId=...`

---

### Use Case 2: Single Term Subscription

**Scenario:**
- Student: Sara Ali (ID: 9)
- Subscription: "English Year 8 - Term 2"
- Subscription dates: 2025-04-01 to 2025-06-30
- Today: 2025-05-15

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "currentTermId": 2,
  "currentTermNumber": 2,
  "currentWeekNumber": 7,
  "hasAccess": true
}
```

---

### Use Case 3: No Active Subscription

**Scenario:**
- Student: New student (ID: 10)
- No active subscriptions

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "hasAccess": false,
  "message": "No active subscription found"
}
```

**Frontend Action:**
- Show "Enroll Now" button instead of "View Lessons"

---

## 6. Database Schema Requirements

### Required Tables/Relationships:

```sql
StudentSubjects
  - StudentId (FK)
  - SubscriptionPlanId (FK)
  - StartDate
  - EndDate
  - IsActive

SubscriptionPlans
  - Id
  - PlanType (SingleTerm, MultiTerm, FullYear, SubjectAnnual)
  - SubjectId (FK, nullable)
  - TermId (FK, nullable)
  - YearId (FK, nullable)

Terms
  - Id
  - TermNumber (1, 2, 3, 4)
  - Name ("Term 1", "Term 2", etc.)
  - StartDate
  - EndDate

Weeks
  - Id
  - TermId (FK)
  - WeekNumber (1-12)
  - StartDate
  - EndDate
```

---

## 7. Alternative: Frontend Calculation

**If backend endpoint not possible**, frontend can calculate:

```typescript
// Get subscription start/end dates from backend
const subscription = {
  startDate: '2025-01-01',
  endDate: '2025-12-31',
  planType: 'FullYear'
};

// Calculate current term (assuming 3 months per term)
const today = new Date();
const start = new Date(subscription.startDate);
const monthsSinceStart = (today.getTime() - start.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30);
const currentTerm = Math.floor(monthsSinceStart / 3) + 1; // 1, 2, 3, or 4
```

**Problems with frontend calculation:**
- ‚ùå Not accurate (months have different days)
- ‚ùå Doesn't account for holidays
- ‚ùå Can't sync with actual term dates in database
- ‚ùå Multiple subscriptions hard to handle

**Conclusion**: Backend endpoint is much better! ‚úÖ

## 8. Frontend Implementation (After Endpoint Available)

```typescript
// In courses.component.ts
viewLessons(course: Course): void {
  const studentId = this.authService.getCurrentUser()?.studentId;
  
  if (!studentId) {
    this.router.navigate(['/login']);
    return;
  }

  // Call new backend endpoint
  this.coursesService.getCurrentTermWeek(studentId, course.id)
    .subscribe(termWeek => {
      if (!termWeek.hasAccess) {
        alert('No active subscription found for this subject');
        return;
      }

      console.log('üìö Navigating to current term:', termWeek);

      this.router.navigate(['/lessons'], {
        queryParams: {
          subjectId: course.subjectNameId,
          yearId: course.yearId,
          termId: termWeek.currentTermId,    // ‚Üê Backend calculated!
          weekId: termWeek.currentWeekId,     // ‚Üê Backend calculated!
          courseId: course.id
        }
      });
    });
}

// In courses.service.ts
getCurrentTermWeek(studentId: number, courseId?: number): Observable<CurrentTermWeekDto> {
  const url = courseId
    ? `${this.baseUrl}/StudentSubjects/student/${studentId}/subject/${courseId}/current-term-week`
    : `${this.baseUrl}/StudentSubjects/student/${studentId}/current-term-week`;
  
  return this.http.get<CurrentTermWeekDto>(url);
}
```

---

## 10. Priority

**üî¥ HIGH**

**Why**:
- Critical for user experience
- Students currently see wrong content (Term 1 always)
- Blocks proper learning flow
- Needed before production release

## 11. Questions for Backend Team

1. ‚úÖ Can you create the endpoint `GET /api/StudentSubjects/student/{studentId}/current-term-week`?
2. ‚úÖ Can you include both termId and weekId in response?
3. ‚úÖ How do you handle "between terms" periods (holidays)?
4. ‚úÖ What happens if student has multiple subscriptions to different subjects?
5. ‚úÖ Should we pass subjectId as query param or separate endpoint?
6. ‚úÖ What's the response format for students with no active subscription?
7. ‚úÖ Can you include subscription expiry date and progress percentage?

**Report Generated**: November 1, 2025  
**Frontend Status**: ‚è≥ **BLOCKED** - Waiting for current term/week endpoint  
**Backend Action Required**: ‚úÖ **HIGH PRIORITY** - Create term/week detection endpoint

---

**Recommendation**: Implement backend endpoint for accurate term/week calculation based on subscription dates and current date. This is essential for proper content navigation.

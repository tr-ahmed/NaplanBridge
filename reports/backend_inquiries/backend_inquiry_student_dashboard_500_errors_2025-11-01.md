   - Are there missing data dependencies?

2. **Error Logs**
   - Full stack trace from backend logs
   - Specific error messages
   - SQL errors (if applicable)

3. **Database State**
   - Is the data properly seeded for student ID 8?
   - Are there missing foreign key relationships?
   - Are there any data integrity issues?

4. **Expected Response Schema**
   - Confirm the exact response structure for each endpoint
   - Provide example of successful response
   - Document all possible error responses

5. **Authentication Requirements**
   - Are the JWT tokens being validated correctly?

## 5. Frontend Current State

### Working Endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/StudentSubjects/student/{studentId}/subscriptions-summary` - Returns data successfully
- ✅ `/api/Achievements/student/{studentId}` - Returns data successfully

### Fixed Frontend Issues:

- ✅ Added array type checking to prevent filter errors
- ✅ Implemented safe error handling for all API calls

### Temporary Workaround:
- Dashboard loads with available data only
- Gracefully handles missing endpoints
- Shows empty states instead of crashing

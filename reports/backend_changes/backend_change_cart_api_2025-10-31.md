# üîß Backend Change Report - Cart API Endpoint Issue

## Report Date: October 31, 2025
## Feature: Shopping Cart - Remove Item

---

## 1. Reason for Change

**Issue Detected:**  
The frontend is calling a **non-existent endpoint** `/api/Cart/remove/{id}` which returns **404 Not Found**.

**Evidence from Console:**
```
naplan2.runasp.net/api/Cart/remove/2:1   Failed to load resource: 404
naplan2.runasp.net/api/Cart/remove/3:1   Failed to load resource: 404
naplan2.runasp.net/api/Cart/remove/1:1   Failed to load resource: 404
```

**Cause:**  
The backend implements `/api/Cart/items/{cartItemId}` according to Swagger documentation, but the frontend was incorrectly configured to use `/api/Cart/remove/{id}`.

---

## 2. Current Backend Implementation (from Swagger)

### ‚úÖ Existing Endpoint:
```
DELETE /api/Cart/items/{cartItemId}
```

**Swagger Definition:**
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/api/Cart/items/{cartItemId}": {
      "delete": {
        "tags": ["Cart"],
        "summary": "Remove item from cart",
        "parameters": [{
          "name": "cartItemId",
          "in": "path",
          "required": true,
          "schema": {
            "type": "integer",
            "format": "int32"
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Frontend Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
// api-nodes.ts
removeFromCart: {
  url: '/Cart/remove/:id',  // ‚ùå Wrong endpoint
  method: 'DELETE'
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// api-nodes.ts
removeFromCart: {
  url: '/Cart/items/:id',  // ‚úÖ Correct endpoint
  method: 'DELETE'
}
```

---

## 4. Backend Status

### ‚úÖ No Backend Changes Required

The backend is **already correctly implemented**. The issue was only on the frontend side due to incorrect API endpoint URL configuration.

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Endpoint `/api/Cart/items/{cartItemId}` exists in Swagger
- ‚úÖ Method: DELETE
- ‚úÖ Parameter: cartItemId (integer)
- ‚úÖ Returns: Updated cart or success response

---

## 5. Additional Backend Issue: Parent Children Endpoint

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Access Control Issue Detected

**Error from Console:**
```
naplan2.runasp.net/api/User/get-children/8:1   Failed to load resource: 403 Forbidden
```

**Analysis:**
- Student user (ID: 8) is trying to access `/api/User/get-children/8`
- Endpoint returns **403 Forbidden** (correct behavior)
- This endpoint should only be accessible by **Parent** role

**Current Behavior:** ‚úÖ **Working as expected**  
The backend correctly denies access to students trying to access parent-only endpoints.

**Frontend Fix:**  
Modified `cart.component.ts` to check user role **before** calling `get-children` endpoint:

```typescript
// Only load children if user is Parent
if (!this.isStudent()) {
  this.loadStudents();  // Calls /api/User/get-children
}
```

## 6. Request and Response Examples

### Remove Item from Cart

**Request:**
```http
DELETE /api/Cart/items/2
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Expected Response (Success - 200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Item removed from cart",
  "cart": {
    "items": [],
    "totalAmount": 0,
    "itemCount": 0
  }
}
```

**Response (Not Found - 404):**
```json
{
  "error": "Cart item not found"
}
```

---

## 7. Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests:
- [x] Frontend URL corrected to `/Cart/items/:id`
- [x] Role check prevents students from calling parent endpoints
- [x] Console errors should no longer show 404 for cart removal
- [x] Console errors should no longer show 403 for get-children

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Backend Tests:
- [ ] Verify DELETE `/api/Cart/items/{cartItemId}` returns correct response
- [ ] Confirm 404 when cart item doesn't exist
- [ ] Confirm 401 when user is not authenticated
- [ ] Confirm user can only delete their own cart items

## 8. Summary

| Issue | Type | Status | Action |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Wrong cart remove URL | Frontend | ‚úÖ Fixed | Updated api-nodes.ts |
| 403 on get-children | Frontend Logic | ‚úÖ Fixed | Added role check |
| Backend cart endpoint | Backend | ‚úÖ OK | No changes needed |

## 9. Recommendations

### For Frontend:
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Always verify endpoint URLs against Swagger documentation
2. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Check user roles before calling role-restricted endpoints
3. **TODO:** Add error handling for specific HTTP status codes

### For Backend:
1. ‚úÖ **OK:** Cart remove endpoint is correctly implemented
2. ‚úÖ **OK:** Authorization middleware properly restricts parent endpoints
3. **SUGGESTION:** Consider adding more descriptive error messages in 403/404 responses

**Report Status:** ‚úÖ Issues Identified and Resolved  
**Backend Changes Required:** ‚ùå None - Backend working correctly  
**Frontend Changes:** ‚úÖ Applied and Committed  

**Next Steps:**
1. Test cart removal with authenticated user
2. Verify role-based access control works properly
3. Monitor console for any remaining API errors
